# DV-Mod-Template
This reporitory is a template for a typical mod for Î”V: Rings of Saturn. A majority of the code here is a derivative of Za'krin's ModMain template, and is only intended as an extension to that repo to add extra functionality ontop of the already powerful design that was already commonplace.

This readme is intended to explain the parts of this template in greater detail than the comments in the code will, alongside a very basic how-to on starting a mod.
