# DV-Mod-Template
This reporitory is a template for a typical mod for ΔV: Rings of Saturn. A majority of the code here is a derivative of [Za'krin's ModMain template](https://github.com/ZakrinYoran/Delta-V-Modding), and is only intended as an extension to that repo to add extra functionality ontop of the already powerful design that was already commonplace.

This readme is intended to explain the parts of this template in greater detail than the comments in the code will, alongside a very basic how-to on starting a mod. Most of this information expects you to have a basic understanding of how a mod is structured, which Za'krin's mod template above does a very good job of explaining and I would highly recommend you read it first if you do not already have experience with Godot and/or ΔV mods.
